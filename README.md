Change the logo
===============
There is two main ways to change the logo of this site.
The first one is prefered.

First way:
----------
* Navigate to `/site/themes/mythemes` in your Lumina directory.
There you will find a file called `logo_80x80.png`.
This is the file that you want to change.

To change the logo, simply:
* Create a new PNG file that is 80x80 pixels.
* Rename it to logo_80x80 (png is the filetyp and is there by default).
* Overwrite the file in the `mythemes` directory with your new file.
* Done. Refresh the page.

Second way:
-----------
* Navigate to `/site/themes/mythemes` in your Lumina directory.
This is the folder there you will place your new logo.

* Create your new logo with your prefered filetype (jpg, png etc).
* Put it in the `mythemes` directory.
* Go to the root of Lumina. Navigate to `/site/`
* Open the config.php file.
* Scroll down to the bottom of the file. 
* The parts that you want to change are named `favicon` and `logo`.
* Simply replace the name of the files with your new one.
* Save the file.
* Done. Refresh the page.

Change the title/header
=======================
* Navigate to `/site/` in your Lumina directory.
* Open the config.php file.
* Scroll down to the bottom of the file.
* The part that you want to change is named `header`.
* Edit the part that says `<h3>Lumina</h3>`
* The `<h3></h3>` is HTML for headings. Change this to your prefered heading size if you're familiar with HTML. Otherwise, just change the part that says `Lumina`.
* Save the file.
* Done. Refresh the page.


Change the footer
=================
* Navigate to `/site/` in your Lumina directory.
